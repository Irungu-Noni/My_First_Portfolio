## 🛠️ What I’ve Worked On
- Understanding the structure of an HTML document
- Basic tags: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- Text formatting: headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs, bold, italic
- Creating lists: ordered and unordered
- Adding links (`<a>`) and images (`<img>`)
- Structuring content using divs and sections
- Using forms and input fields
- Nesting elements properly
- Learning about semantic HTML
- Using VS Code extensions like Live Server

## 🪲 Bugs I’ve Squashed
- Forgot to close some tags, which messed up my layout 😅
- Mixed up attribute syntax (quotes and equal signs)
- Struggled with image paths not displaying – turns out the file path was wrong

---

## ✅ What I’ve Achieved
- Gained confidence writing clean HTML structure
- Created my first basic webpage 🎉
- Improved my attention to detail when nesting elements
- Can explain the difference between block and inline elements

## 💡 Note to Self
You're doing amazing! Keep showing up for yourself, one tag at a time. Mistakes are just stepping stones to understanding. You’ve got this 💪🏽
